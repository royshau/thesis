ver1 - Encoder network, L2 loss
ver2 - Encoder network, L2 loss, Weaker discriminator, deconv+ l1
ver3 - multi-channel, L1, weaker discriminator
ver4 - zeroPadding, mask = get_random_mask(w=256, h=256, factor=5, start_line=movi_x, keep_center=0.2)
ver5 - zeroPadding,  mask as in ver4, add bias to images in order to have zero meaning,
