ver1 - Encoder network, L2 loss
ver2 - Encoder network, L2 loss, Weaker discriminator, deconv+ l1
ver3 - multi-channel, L1, weaker discriminator
ver4 - zeroPadding, mask = get_random_mask(w=256, h=256, factor=5, start_line=movi_x, keep_center=0.2)
ver5 - zeroPadding,  mask as in ver4, add bias to images in order to have zero meaning, 
ver6 - zeroPadding, sampling factor of 2, with 0.2, add bias to images in order to have zero meaning, 
ver7 - noisePadding, no bias adding, factor 2 with 0.2 + L2 -> works good
ver7 - noisePadding, no bias adding, factor 3 with 0.1 + L2 -> nice, no to good
ver7 - noisePadding, no bias adding, factor 2 with 0.01 + L2 -> nice, no to good
ver8 - noisePadding, no bias adding, factor 2 with 0.01 + L2, 2 networks
