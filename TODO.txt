TODO:
DONE 1. Interface with nibabel (niftty lib) for easy reading data base
2. Convert data-base to like-mnist style, for easy reading with tensorflow
3. Create examples using random subsampling
4. Develop network code with tensorBoard

SubTasks:

dataCreator:
	DONE - 1. Add prints to dataCreator
	2. Add show option to dataCreator
	DONE - 3. Create meta data
	DONE - 4. Do the train/test division in the dataCreator step

shuffle:
	DONE - 1. Develop shuffle script

fileHandler:
	1. Handle the issue with the reshape blob

viewers:
	1. Create generic viewer
	2. Create viewer for trainin examples

Matlab:
	Run all interpolation methods for comparison

DataBase:
	DONE - 1. Create mnist-like data base with get_batch(50) method.
		- load 1000 examples
		- shuffle them (permute)
		- update number of examples which was seen

TensorFlow:
	1. Develop a network

General:
	1. Add run-form command line class, as I have in work

Data:
1. What is the best representation to imaeg & kspace
    image - int16?
    k_space - currently float64, but quantized to int16, ASK TAMMY!

    k_space:
    The values are very small, but int is > 0, need to to normalization and
    save the factor in meta_data
